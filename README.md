# budget-tracker

The budget tracker allows the user to either add or subtract funds for anything they spend money on or any money they recuperate. It also displays a chart to show a visual representation of where the user currently stands from a financial standpoint, based on the information they entered into the application. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a service worker.
